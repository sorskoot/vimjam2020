Idea:
You are standing at an altar in a cave. The altar lights up in 3 different colors. 
You'll have to follow the directions and go to the corresponding exits of the room 
to find a gem. You need to go through the exits in reverse order to get back to the
alter. After returning the gem you get 4 different colors and it starts over. 
The goal is to collect as much gems as possible. A bit like the electronic Simon 
Says game.
Maybe we could add variations where it shows a non-existing color or gives you 
an action like ducking or standing to the left or right to prevent death in a 
room at that point.
I think it's possible to build a proof of concept game in less than one week in 
A-Frame, because we need to go VR :). 
If we have enough time we can add better graphics.


Must Have:
    ☐ Room with Altar showing the colors
    ☐ Room with Exits
    ☐ Room with Gems
    Game part:
        ☐ Generate a color combination - start with 3 add a extra color every time. 
        ☐ The sequence gets 1 longer every time a gem is returned. 
        ☐ It's a whole new sequence every time.
