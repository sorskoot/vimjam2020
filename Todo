You are standing at an altar in a cave. The altar lights up in 3 different colors. 
You'll have to follow the directions and go to the corresponding exits of the room 
to find a gem. You need to go through the exits in reverse order to get back to the
alter. After returning the gem you get 4 different colors and it starts over. 
The goal is to collect as much gems as possible. A bit like the electronic Simon 
Says game.
Maybe we could add variations where it shows a non-existing color or gives you 
an action like ducking or standing to the left or right to prevent death in a 
room at that point.
I think it's possible to build a proof of concept game in less than one week in 
A-Frame, because we need to go VR :). 
If we have enough time we can add better graphics.

Must Have:
    ✔ Teleportation @done(20-09-21 23:17)
    ☐ Replay sequence when touching Altar without Gem.
    ☐ Go through the exit when close and touching in VR
    ☐ Teleport to navmesh
    Models:
        ☐ Exits
        ☐ Altar
        ☐ Gem
        ☐ General room stuff like rocks and pathways

Should Have:
    ☐ Fade effect between rooms

Could have:

Ideas:
    - Use the A-Frame/Three.js Effects to get glow/bloom
    - Use navmesh
    - Use Teleport-component
